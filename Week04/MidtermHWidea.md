Concept/Theme: Sophie (Clothing Brand)
- Basically going to be like an online clothing store for the brand I would like to one day own called Sophie. It will contain actual clothing I’ve designed, a brand identity, clothing prices, a magazine for the clothes, store location, contact information, and socials.

Concepts/Skills We Have Covered That You Will Use:
 - I’m going to make buttons with links that access new tabs

Concepts/Skills You Need To Still Learn to Complete the Project:
- 3D render clothing. 
- Also making a 3D object move at a steady pace, kind of know how to do this. 
- I want to make jpegs in illustrator that are hazy and can seem like Icons.
